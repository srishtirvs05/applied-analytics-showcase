## üìÅ Projects

### 1. Heating Load Prediction for Energy-Efficient Buildings
**Objective:** Predict residential heating load based on architectural features using both regression and classification models.

- **Tools Used:** R, ggplot2, randomForest, caret, e1071
- **Techniques Applied:** Exploratory data analysis, multicollinearity checks, linear regression, decision trees, SVM, ensemble learning
- **Key Takeaway:** Identified building compactness and overall height as top predictors; Random Forest and Decision Trees achieved ~98% prediction accuracy
- **Business Impact:** Offers data-backed recommendations for optimizing building design to reduce energy consumption
- **Project Folder:** [(https://github.com/srishtirvs05/applied-analytics-showcase/tree/main/Predicting%20Heating%20Load%20for%20Energy%20Efficient%20Buildings%20Using%20Machine%20Learning))]

### 2. Energy Usage in the Carolinas ‚Äì Summer Demand Forecasting
**Objective:** Analyze hourly residential energy use across North and South Carolina to assess the impact of household structure, insulation, and weather patterns on summer electricity demand.

- **Tools Used:** R, dplyr, Poisson regression, SVM, linear modeling
- **Techniques Applied:** Data merging, weather normalization, regression modeling, and interactive dashboard creation (Shiny)
- **Key Takeaway:** Energy demand was driven primarily by outdoor temperature, insulation quality, and AC system type
- **Business Impact:** Provides utility companies with actionable insights for demand-side management and consumer targeting
- **Project Folder:** [`Project2_CarolinasEnergyAnalysis`](./Project2_CarolinasEnergyAnalysis)
