# 🔥 Predicting Heating Load for Energy Efficient Buildings

This project analyzes building characteristics to predict heating load using machine learning techniques, with the goal of optimizing design choices for sustainable construction.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [UCI Energy Efficiency Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency)
- 768 observations with 8 input features (e.g., surface area, wall area, roof area, glazing)
- Target: Heating Load

## 📌 Objective
To build predictive models for heating load based on building design features and compare algorithm performance to support energy-efficient architectural choices.

## 🧠 Methods
- Exploratory data analysis
- Correlation matrix & pair plots
- Regression Models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Decision Tree

## 📈 Key Findings
- Relative Compactness and Surface Area are the most influential features.
- Random Forest outperformed others in predicting Heating Load with lower RMSE.
